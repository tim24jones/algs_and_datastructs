__radd__ vs __add__:
radd calls the second of the sum instead of the first (reverse adding)

__iadd__:
iadd replaces the original value by the summed value.  Does not work well with immutable types

__str__ tries to convert things into strings to be readable
__repr__ is a representation of an object which evals back to the object
